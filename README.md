There's a rumor says that:

> Don't throw away what can be used again: even an old calendar becomes new again every 28 years. Start the new year with a resolution: recycle. Please, don't waste this page. Remove it and hang it on your wall.

Is that true?

This tool will give you the answer.

## What's this for

To find a year in the future to resue your current calendar.
